"A Speech-To-Text app that make note taking easier than ever"

# About the Project
  Have you ever been in a lecture where you need to pay all your attention, and yet take notes? Did you struggle to do both together? Don't worry, we've got you covered!
  We present an app that you can switch on during a lecture, and it converts everything the professor says into notes!
  
# How to run the app?
- Make sure the app is in your working directory
- Run the command "python3 GUI.py" in your terminal 
- The GUI will open, and give you an option to start/stop recording the conversation
- As the recording occurs, you will be able to see the transcripts of the speech on the terminal
- Wait for at least 20 seconds after the last word being spoken before clicking "stop recording"
- A transcription.txt file with the complete output will be generated and stored in the same directory
